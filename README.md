========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

# When I used camel case when I did mine, I knew I was diverging from the lecture, so I specifically added the statement to the effect of "due to the length of the names I have used capitals to mark the start of each part"
